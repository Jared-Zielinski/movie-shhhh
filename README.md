This was the final project for *CS492-Mobile Application Development*. It was developed by Jared Zielinski, Lawson Dietz, and Liaqiang Huang and was completed in one week and submitted on 03-16-2022.

The goal of this android app is to automatically silence your phone when you are in a theater or other user specified location. Theater locations are aquired from a RESTful service provided by MovieGlu.

There are a number of tasks that should be attended to in future development. Unit tests, updating the geocaches when the user changes a setting, we could possibly add a feature to allow the user to select a ring profile instead of simply silencing the phone.

The project was a realtively successful proof of concept given the short time frame.
