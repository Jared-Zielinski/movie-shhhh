This was the final project for *CS492-Mobile Application Development*. It was developed by Jared Zielinski, Lawson Dietz, and Liaqiang Huang and was completed in one week.

There are a number of tasks that should be attended to in future development. Unit tests, updating the geocaches when the user changes a setting, we could possibly add a feature to allow the user to select a ring profile instead of simply silencing the phone. Given the short timeframe the project was a successful proof of concept.
